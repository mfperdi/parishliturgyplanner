## Web interface

The project now includes a standalone web experience powered entirely by Apps Script HTML Service. Deploy it as a web app in the Apps Script editor (Deploy → New deployment → Web app) and set "Execute as" to "Me". The `doGet` handler renders `WebApp.html`, giving you buttons to generate calendars, schedules, assignments, substitutes, and printable views without opening the spreadsheet sidebar.
