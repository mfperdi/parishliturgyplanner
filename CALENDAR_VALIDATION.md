## What To Do If Dates Don't Match

**Problem**: The Computus algorithm might have an error
**Solution**: Check `1a_calendardates.gs` Easter calculation function
**Workaround**: Use CalendarOverrides sheet to manually set Easter

### If Advent is wrong:
**Problem**: Calculation of 4th Sunday before Christmas might be off
**Solution**: Check Advent Sunday calculation in `1b_calendarseasons.gs`
**Workaround**: Use CalendarOverrides sheet

### If colors are wrong:
**Problem**: Precedence rules or color mapping issue
**Solution**: Check `LITURGICAL_COLORS` in `0_liturgicalcolors.gs`
**Fix**: Add override in CalendarOverrides sheet

### If seasons don't align:
**Problem**: Ordinary Time calculation gaps
**Solution**: Review `CALENDAR_getSeasonalCelebration()` in `1b_calendarseasons.gs`

## Automated Validation Test

To validate programmatically, you can create a test function:

```javascript
function TEST_validateCalendar2025() {
  const calendar = HELPER_readSheetData(CONSTANTS.SHEETS.CALENDAR);
  const errors = [];

  // Check Easter 2025
  const easter = calendar.find(row => {
    const date = new Date(row[0]);
    return date.getMonth() === 3 && date.getDate() === 20 && date.getFullYear() === 2025;
  });

  if (!easter || !easter[2].includes('Easter')) {
    errors.push('Easter 2025 not found on April 20');
  }

  // Add more checks...

  if (errors.length === 0) {
    Logger.log('✓ Calendar validation passed!');
    return 'PASSED';
  } else {
    Logger.log('❌ Calendar validation failed:');
    errors.forEach(e => Logger.log(`  - ${e}`));
    return 'FAILED: ' + errors.join('; ');
  }
}
```

## Final Notes

- **The system's Easter calculation is mathematically correct** using the Computus algorithm
- **Regional variations are important** - make sure "Calendar Region" in Config is set correctly
- **Optional Memorials** may vary by diocese - use CalendarOverrides for local saints
- **Colors are liturgically accurate** but your parish may use variations
- **When in doubt, use your parish's printed Ordo** as the final authority

✅ **If major dates match (Easter, Advent, Christmas), your calendar is valid!**
